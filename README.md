<h1>Advent</h1>

This is a repository used for generating solutions for the Advent of Code.
As my first year participating in this challenge, I've been very excited every
night to create solutions as fast as I can.

https://adventofcode.com/2018

My goal for this year is to get 50 stars.  We'll see how close I can get!

My solutions are definitely not elegant and I use brute force.  With the loops
within loops within loops, I'm certain my algorithms are approaching O(N^3+).

Perhaps when this year is over, I'll go through the previous years' advent
challenges and attempt to find some elegant solutions.

<h3>Spoiler Alert</h3>
These are solutions that worked for my input sets.  Be advised that you may
discover answers to questions you don't want answered.
